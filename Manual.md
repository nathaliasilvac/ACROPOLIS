# ACROPOLIS: User Manual
To use the application, the user must perform a pre-processing step, which involves estimating the input data for the model, collecting terrain details, and locating the areas of concern to evaluate.
This manual provides a step-by-step guide for the user, from data pre-processing to estimating the reservoir classification.
## Pre-process:
The pre-processing is divided into four parts: 1) Downloading the digital elevation model (DEM), 2) Assigning roughness, 3) Locating affected areas, and 4) Estimating physical parameters.
