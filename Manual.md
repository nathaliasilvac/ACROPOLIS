# ACROPOLIS: User Manual
To use the application, the user must perform a pre-processing step, which involves estimating the input data for the model, collecting terrain details, and locating the areas of concern to evaluate.
This manual provides a step-by-step guide for the user, from data pre-processing to estimating the reservoir classification.
# 1. Pre-process:
The pre-processing is divided into four parts: 1) Downloading the digital elevation model (DEM), 2) Assigning roughness, 3) Locating affected areas, and 4) Estimating physical parameters.

## 1.1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM):
There are different portals and tools to download digital elevation models. Spain has the [Download Center of the National Geographic Institute (IGN)](https://centrodedescargas.cnig.es/CentroDescargas/index.jsp), where it is possible to download geographic information for free. With the coordinates of the reservoir, it is possible to search for and download the DEM.
