# ACROPOLIS: Classification of risk for off-stream reservoirs using Machine Learning
![Window](Images/Window.png)
ACROPOLIS is a  tool designed for the classification of risk associated with off-stream reservoirs. Utilizing a  Machine Learning algorithm, the tool offers a fast and efficient method for the preliminary estimation of risk classification in these reservoirs [(Silva-Cancino et al., 2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/15/2416?utm_campaign=releaseissue_waterutm_medium=emailutm_source=releaseissueutm_term=doilink114). Its incorporation of advanced technology enables users to swiftly assess and categorize risk levels, providing valuable insights for reservoir management and decision-making processes.

## The software tool provides:
1. Visualization of the flow accumulation based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
2. Classification of areas of interest (AoI) as "risk" or "no risk".
3. Overall classification of risk of the off-stream reservoir (A, B or C)
4. Stochastic analysis
