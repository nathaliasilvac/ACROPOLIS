# ACROPOLIS
![Window](Images/Window.png)
ACROPOLIS is a  tool designed for the classification of risk associated with off-stream reservoirs. Utilizing a  Machine Learning algorithm, the tool offers a fast and efficient method for the preliminary estimation of risk classification in these reservoirs (Silva-Cancino et al., 2022). Its incorporation of advanced technology enables users to swiftly assess and categorize risk levels, providing valuable insights for reservoir management and decision-making processes.

## The software tool provides:
1. Visualization of the flow accumulation based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
2. Classification of areas of interest (AoI) as "risk" or "not risk".
3. Overall classification of risk of the off-stream reservoir (A, B or C)
4. Stochastic analysis
